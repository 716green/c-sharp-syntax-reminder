# C# SYNTAX REMINDER

## PURPOSE

As a JavaScript developer, I get rusty with my C# after going months on end without using it.

This is the exact app I create every time I need to brush up on my C# syntax.

I'm pushing this to my GitHub because I'd rather just reference it as opposed to re-create it next time.

Feel free to add to it. This is nothing besides a visual syntax reminder with some goofy methods for fun.

## Pythagorean theorem

```latex
a^2 + b^2 = c^2
```
